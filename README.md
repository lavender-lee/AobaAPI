# AobaAPI - a C++ API/library for 3D polygonal mesh modeling

A standalone C++ library for 3D modeling  

Developed as a part of the Graduate(Master's) thesis at the *Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Information Technology Osijek*.

## Features
- No dependencies
- Lightweight
- Custom mathematics library with 2d/3d/4d vectors and matrices
- Flexible data structure supporting non-manifold geometry
- Low level(Euler) operators for local topology modification and implementation of advanced tools
- Advanced 3D modeling operators - Primitive creation, extrusion, geometric transformations
- Subdivision
- .obj, .stl file export
- Conversion to index/triangle based type suitable for rendering. 

## Example projects
See the AobaExamples repository at  
https://github.com/lsimic/AobaExamples  
Includes several modeling examples and showcases how to include the API into other projects
